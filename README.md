##How To Play
Win the big tic-tac-toe board by getting __three in a row__ - either across, down, or diagonally - or getting a __majority of the squares__. In order to earn one of the nine squares in the big board, you must win the smaller tic-tac-toe board contained within it.

__Your opponent's previous move determines which board(s) you are allowed to play in__. For example, if your opponent chose the top right square of the center board, you would then have to choose an open square in the top right board.

If your opponent's previous move would force you to play in a board which has already been won, you can select any open square on the whole board.

##Game Modes
__CPU opponent:__ Test your wits against a computer AI.

__Random opponent:__ Play against another random person on the Internet.

__Play with the crowd:__ Test the wisdom of the crowd against a computer AI. You - along with every other human player - have a limited amount of time to choose a next move. After that time, the most commonly chosen square is picked as the humans' collective move.
